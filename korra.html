      <p>The art design of Republic City, described as "if Manhattan had happened in Asia,"
         was inspired by the 1920s and incorporates influences from American and European architecture
        from that time period.[5] Elements of film noir and steampunk also influenced the city's art
         concept. The design for the metalbending
        police force is based on 1920s New York City police uniforms, crossed with samurai armor.[27]
      <p>The fighting styles employed by characters in the original show Avatar: The Last Airbender
        were derived from different distinct styles of Chinese martial arts.[28] Set 70 years later,
        the fighting style in the multicultural Republic City has modernized and blended,[29][30]
        with the creators incorporating three primary styles: traditional Chinese martial arts, mixed
        martial arts, and tricking. The pro-bending sport introduced in the series was inspired by mixed
        martial arts (MMA) tournaments.[27][31]
      <p>Chinese martial arts instructor Sifu Kisu consulted on Avatar: The Last Airbender, and returned
        as a consultant for the fight scenes in The Legend of Korra. MMA fighters Jeremy Humphries and
        Mac Danzig were credited with "providing a lot of the moves you'll see in the Probending arena,"
        and Steve Harada and Jake Huang provided the stylized flips and acrobatics of "tricking" to the
        series' fighting style.[31]

      <p>The Legend of Korra was initially conceived as a twelve-episode miniseries.
         Nickelodeon declined the creators' pitch for an Avatar: The Last Airbender follow-up animated
          movie based on what then became the three-part comics The Promise, The Search and The Rift,
          choosing instead to expand Korra to 26 episodes.[3] The series was expanded further in July 2012
          to 52 episodes. These episodes are grouped into four separate seasons ("Books") composed of twelve
          to fourteen episodes ("Chapters") each, with each season telling a stand-alone story. Beginning
          with episode 9 of season 3, new episodes were first distributed through the Internet rather
          than broadcast.
          The Legend of Korra concluded with the fourth season.[4]
